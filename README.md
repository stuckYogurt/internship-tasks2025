# Tasks 1.1-1.4

## Compiling

To compile, type `make` or `make build` in directory.

## Testing

Testing requires python 3.11+ (library requirment) and NetworkX, matplotlib libraries.To test, type `build test`.

Testing files are auto generated and stored in directory tests/, then fed into program itself and validator. For every test there is, output of both alrogithms is shown. Program's output might differ from validator's, which isn't necessarily an error. In that case, graph is graphically shown for convenience.
